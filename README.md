# react-tic-tac-toe-test

Your task is to create a tic-tac-toe react app with tests that provide assurance that a user will win if there are three adjacent spaced filled or if there is a tie. Any architecture, libraries, and frameworks that you wish to use are entirely at your discretion. Do not worry about persisting state if a user navigates away from the app, or supporting computer driven AI.

The app should change the user based on what turn is currently being played (e.g. Turn one when a user clicks should place an 'X' while turn two when the user clicks should place an 'O')

If a winner is decided, there should be some notification on whether player one or player two has won.

We have provided some image assets  for you to use for your various players.
